indexing:- starts from zero ends at -1
-> in one d array we use the index 
-> in two d array we use the rows and cols
slicing the array means to cut the subset of an array
flatten and ravel 
boolean masking

Why do we need to modify the array?
we need to add the new data points and remove the obsolute data etc

np.insert() to insert the new element.

Rowwise stacking and col wise stacking
vstack and hstack
hsplit
vsplit works for 2d array

vectorization:- applying the operation on an entire array at once. 100x faster than loops.

learn list comprehension.

broadcasting: matches expands smaller arrays to larger arrays and is faster than loops
